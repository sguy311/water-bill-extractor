# Water Bill Extractor - Project Summary

## Project Overview
This application uses OCR and AI to extract key data (date, water usage, cost) from water bill images and store them in a spreadsheet for tracking and analysis.

## Progress to Date (April 16, 2025)

### Completed
1. **Project Setup**
   - Created basic directory structure following Python package conventions
   - Set up requirements.txt with necessary dependencies
   - Created README.md with installation and usage instructions

2. **Core Functionality**
   - Built main application entry point that accepts image paths via command line
   - Implemented OCR text extraction using Tesseract
   - Created image preprocessing pipeline to improve OCR accuracy
   - Developed regex-based extractors for date, usage, and cost data
   - Added spreadsheet storage functionality

3. **External Dependencies**
   - Integrated Tesseract OCR for text extraction
   - Added OpenAI API integration for fallback extraction when regex fails

### Current Components
- **main.py**: Command-line interface and orchestration
- **models/bill_data.py**: Data structure for storing extracted bill information
- **ai/ocr.py**: OCR and text extraction logic
- **ai/image_processor.py**: Image preprocessing to improve OCR quality
- **data/spreadsheet_manager.py**: Excel spreadsheet operations

### Current Challenges
- OCR quality varies with different bill formats
- Usage value extraction needs refinement for certain bill layouts
- Handling bills with multiple pages or complex formatting

## Next Steps

1. **Functionality Enhancements**
   - Refine pattern matching for water usage extraction
   - Add PDF support (convert PDF pages to images)
   - Implement more robust error handling
   - Add logging for better debugging

2. **User Experience**
   - Create a simple GUI interface
   - Add progress indicators during processing
   - Implement batch processing for multiple bills

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Create unit tests
   - Add validation for extracted data
   - Test with diverse water bill formats

4. **Documentation**
   - Add inline code documentation
   - Create user guide with screenshots
   - Document common error cases and solutions

## Testing Status
- Basic extraction working for simple bill formats
- OCR works well on clear images but needs improvement for low-quality scans
- Spreadsheet integration complete and tested

## Environment Setup
- Python 3.7+ required
- Tesseract OCR must be installed and configured
- OpenAI API key needed for AI extraction fallback
